##  How Science and Technology Are for Society

Scientific and technological activities refers to
the elucidation of unknown phenomena, and to the
creation of new knowledge through the discovery of
new natural laws and principles, and the new
knowledge obtained is then utilized in the real
society. The essence of how science and technology
contributes to society is the creation of new
knowledge, and then utilization of that knowledge
to boost the prosperity of human lives, and to solve
the various issues facing society.
With the shift to a knowledge-based society well
underway in the opening years of the 21st century,
the creation of new knowledge is an increasingly
important aspect of scientific and technological
activities, and the role of science in this knowledge
creation is important for the realization of “science
and technology for society.”

## New Policy Developments Related to Science and Technology for Society :

###  Scientific and Technological Progress Related to Safety and Security 
The multiple terror attacks of September 11,
2001 killed several thousand victims in an instant,
an attack unparalleled in international society.
Again, on March 11, 2004, an explosion on a
commuter train in Madrid, Spain left more than 200
dead and more than 1,700 injured. This incident
acutely brought home to people in Japan and
elsewhere the extent of the threat that terrorism
raises.
Turning to Japan, this is a nation that was often
beset by natural disasters. As a result of the
implementation of disaster prevention policies,
losses due to natural disasters have been declining
in recent years. Nevertheless, the Great
Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake of January 17, 1995 left
more than 6,000 people dead, a larger number of
disaster victims than the total numbers recorded in
any single year since the end of World War II.
In the area of security, a total of 2,853,739
criminal incidents were recorded in FY2002,
marking the seventh straight year that a postwar
record was registered. Moreover, the arrest and
incarceration rate fell to an all-time low, graphically
demonstrating a rapid deterioration in security, and
the people’s insecurity is increasing .
