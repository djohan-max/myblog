## **Robot**
>A *robot* is a mechatronic device (combining mechanics, electronics and computers) designed to automatically accomplish tasks that imitate or reproduce, in a specific field, human actions. The design of these systems is the subject of a scientific discipline, a branch of automatism called robotics

## Robotics and automation, from industry to home
A word coined by Isaac Asimov, robotics consists of all the techniques to make a robot, that is, an automatic machine. This science has gone from fiction to reality since the era of the writer, famous for his four laws that must dictate their behavior. From heavy industrial robotics, to the medical or military fields, including domestic robotics, machines have invaded our daily lives. Advances in software and artificial intelligence controlling them already allow us to replace us - at least in part - on many increasingly complex tasks, such as driving with autonomous cars, or too dangerous, such as driving. exploration of another planet or a radioactive site. The possibility of the development of autonomous offensive weapons, or "killer robots", however worries the UN and many scientists.

### What are the advantages?
  * In many situations robots can increase productivity, efficiency, quality and consistency of products:
      * Unlike humans, robots don’t get bored
      * Until they wear out, they can do the same thing again and again
  * They can be very accurate – to fractions of an inch (as is needed for example in manufacturing of microelectronics)
  * Robots can work in environments which are unsafe for humans – in the nuclear or chemical industries for example
  *  Robots don’t have the same environmental requirements that humans do – such as lighting, air conditioning or noise protection
  * Robots have some sensors/actuators which are more capable than humans

### What are the disadvantages?
* The use of robots can create economic problems if they replace human jobs
* Robots can only do what they are told to do – they can’t improvise
   * This means that safety procedures are needed to protect humans and other robots
* Although robots can be superior to humans in some ways, they are less dextrous than humans, they don’t have such powerful brains, and cannot compete with a human’s ability to understand what they can see.
* Often robots are very costly – in terms of the initial cost, maintenance, the need for extra components and the need to be programmed to do the task.
