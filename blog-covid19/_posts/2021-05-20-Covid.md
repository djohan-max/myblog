## **Coronavirus**

**Cronavirus** disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. There was an epidemiological association with a seafood market in Wuhan where there was also a sale of wild animals, which was closed on 01/01/2020. 1 Case was first reported to WHO on 12/31/2019 of unknown pneumonia with the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission saying they were monitoring the situation closely. Subsequent information was provided on 11th and 12th of January. The genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV was reported to the WHO on 01/12/2020 and noted to be a β CoV of group 2B with at least 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV and has been named 2019-nCoV

Subsequently, five additional 2019-nCoV sequences were deposited on the GSAID database on 11th January from institutes across China (Chinese CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College) and allowed researchers around the world to begin analyzing the new CoV. By 17th January, there were 62 confirmed cases in China and importantly, three exported cases of infected travelers who were diagnosed in Thailand (2) and Japan (1). Within 1 month, this virus spread quickly throughout China during the Chinese New Year – a period when there is a high level of human mobility among Chinese people .

The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide crossed the one million mark on 04/02/2020; the case fatality rate (CFT) across 204 countries and territories was 5·2%. By comparison, the SARS epidemic infected 8096 people in 29 countries from November, 2002, to July, 2003, and had a case fatality rate of 9·6%, whereas the MERS outbreak infected 2494 people in 27 countries from April, 2012, to November, 2019, and had a case fatality rate of 34·4%
