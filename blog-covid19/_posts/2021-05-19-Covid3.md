Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019, has rapidly spread throughout China and globally. Although belonging to the same family, SARS-CoV-2 has different clinical and epidemiological characteristics from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Its high transmissibility resembles that observed for pandemic influenza viruses; however, tools for diagnosis, treatment, and vaccines still need tremendous work to achieve the levels needed to respond to a pandemic flu.

Although other measures designed to respond to and control a pandemic such as surveillance, quarantine, and social distancing work efficiently to flatten the curve at a major cost to the economy, the development and deployment of effective tests, drugs, and vaccines to protect lives and limit disease spread are still urgent. Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) expedite the availability of drugs to prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. For many drugs that are already marketed for other conditions, off-label use can increase access for patients who need them. Currently, thousands of clinical trials are ongoing to test clinical outcomes. Adequate clinical trials will soon confirm or refute the usefulness of several candidate drugs and vaccines in treating and preventing COVID-19. Here, we review the state of diagnostic tests, initial clinical experience on accessible drugs and convalescent plasma administered to patients with COVID-19, and updated information on vaccine development against COVID-19.

### Diagnosis
For COVID-19 patients, fever and cough are the two most common symptoms, and some patients might also suffer from sputum production, sore throat, headache, myalgia/arthralgia, rhinorrhea, and diarrhea . Shortness of breath and dyspnea occur in cases that have progressed to pneumonia. Of note, a substantial proportion of patients reported olfactory and gustatory disorders, and thus sudden anosmia or ageusia may represent a clinical screening tool to identify COVID-19 patients. Most patients had normal or decreased leukocyte count, lymphopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein, and some also had thrombocytopenia and elevated D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine aminotransferase. In patients with pneumonia, ground-glass opacity is the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and it may be obscure on chest X-ray; in patients with severe pneumonia, local or bilateral patchy consolidation has also been seen on CT images. However, these clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings are nonspecific and cannot differentiate COVID-19 from other viral respiratory infections; viral diagnostic methods specific for SARS-CoV-2 should be applied for disease confirmation.

### Nucleic-acid-based molecular methods
The current standard diagnostics for COVID-19 are based on detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), usually through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with conformation by sequence analysis when necessary . Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays also appear to be a simple and sensitive diagnostic tool without a requirement high-level facilities and instruments. Samples recommended for testing are those from the lower respiratory tract, including sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and endotracheal aspirates when possible. Sputum, nasopharyngeal swab (NP), and oropharyngeal swabs (OP) are the most common sample types taken from patients with mild to moderate illness. If both NP and OP are collected, they can be placed in the same tube and tested simultaneously to save reagents. In general, BAL showed the highest positive rates, followed by sputum, NP, and OP in order of decreasing sensitivity . Throat gargling samples are an alternative specimen, although they are less sensitive than sputum .

**The laboratory** confirmation of cases in regions without COVID-19 virus circulation requires detection of two different genetic targets of the COVID-19 viral genome, while in regions with established COVID-19 virus circulation, confirmation through detection of a single genetic target is considered sufficient. Many national laboratories have established and published their diagnostic protocols, which are summarized on the World Health Organization (WHO) website . For example, the Charité protocol from Germany recommended detecting the E (envelope) gene for screening, followed by confirmation of E gene-positive samples through detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, where the E assay is specific for all SARS-CoV related viruses (i.e., SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and bat-derived SARS-related CoV) and the RdRP assay using the P2 probe only detects SARS-CoV-2 .

### Pharyngeal virus shedding 
is very high during the first week of symptoms, and viral RNA shedding from sputum persists even after resolution of symptoms and seroconversion . In a study with most samples (>90%) taken from the lower respiratory tract, the median duration of RNA detection was 17 days (interquartile range, 13–22 days) after illness onset, and independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding (>15 days) included male sex, delayed hospital admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation. However, viral RNA does not equate to a live virus, and more data are needed to realize whether viral RNA load correlates with infectivity.

It has also been noted that a negative NAAT result does not mean that COVID-19 is absent, since several factors can lead to false-negative results. These factors include inappropriate sample collection or transportation, sample collection at time when the patient was not shedding sufficient virus, and technical reasons. Periodically sequencing the evolving viruses is also suggested to monitor any mutations in the regions targeted by the assays that might affect test performance . Moreover, the presence of a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen does not preclude the possibility of COVID-19; approximately one-fifth of specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2 were positive for one or more additional common respiratory viruses.

### Virus isolation
Virus isolation is essential to obtain isolates for characterization and to support the development of antivirals and vaccines. However, although SARS-CoV-2 can be cultured in selected cell lines, such as Vero cells and LLC-MK2 cells, in a biosafety level-3 laboratory (BSL-3), viral isolation is not recommended as a routine diagnostic procedure due to biosafety concerns and time constraints Studies have indicated that infectious virus can be readily isolated during the first week of symptoms, with sputum having a higher culture yield than NP or OP; however, infectious virus could not be isolated from samples taken 8 days after onset despite ongoing high viral load detected by RT-PCR. It appears that virus isolation success depends on viral load, as culture failed to yield virus when samples contained <106 copies per mL or per sample. Further studies elucidating the duration of culture-positivity would provide a rationale for proposing strategies of isolation of infected patients.

### Serological antibody tests
Serological antibody detection is the other broad category of tests to diagnose COVID-19, and this method detects IgM, IgG, or total antibodies (typically in the blood) against SARS-CoV-2. Techniques used for antibody detection include virus neutralization assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunochromatographic assay, chemiluminescent immunoassay, etc.Most tests are designed to capture antibodies, which recognize the nucleocapsid (N) protein and the S1 subunit and receptor biding domain (RBD) of Spike (S) proteins, as N and S proteins are the two major coronavirus immunogens . RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from two B cell clones of one COVID-19 patient have demonstrated impressive binding and neutralizing activity against live SARS-CoV-2. Of importance, these serologic tests should not cross-react with other seasonal coronaviruses.

Nevertheless the use of antibody tests is limited to settings of acute illness because it takes time for hosts to mount an adequate immune response. Studies indicate that the majority of patients have seroconversion 2 weeks after symptom onset. Less than 40% of patients had detectable antibodies within 1 week of onset, but this percentage rapidly increased to 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) 15 days after onset, with the median seroconversion time of 12 and 14 days, respectively  IgM began to decline 4 weeks after symptom onset, while IgG remained at high levels after 7 weeks  Based on the time course of seroconversion, serological tests could be used as complementary tools to identify patients presenting late in their illness . As mentioned earlier, seroconversion has not usually been followed by a rapid decline in viral RNA load .

### Serological tests 
may also aid in (i) contact tracing, (ii) assessment of prior infection and immunity to SARS–CoV-2 (if there is protective immunity), (iii) determining the extent of the pandemic with seroprevalence data, and (iv) vaccine evaluation studies. To date, it is not known whether antibodies elicited by SARS–CoV-2 provide protective immunity against reinfection and how long the protective immunity lasts. A rhesus macaque study does suggest protective immunity after recovery from primary infection, since reinfection did not occur in convalescent monkeys rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the situation in humans.

Rapid antigen-detection methods using immunoassays targeted at N or S proteins are under development, although with the same challenge of low sensitivity observed in influenza virus antigen tests. To date, a number of laboratory-developed assays and commercially available kits (mostly NAATs and serological antibody tests) have been granted an EUA by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which greatly strengthens the diagnostic capability of frontline clinical laboratories .

### Therapies
Currently, there are no drugs or other therapies approved by the US FDA to treat COVID-19. The major clinical treatment and management approaches emphasize the importance of life supportive care and relief of complications. Oxygen-based therapy has been applied when patients experience dyspnea, and advanced sepsis management has been warranted for patients who progressed to severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

No existing antiviral drugs have sufficient evidence that they efficaciously treat COVID-19 pneumonia. Some drugs have been selected to treat COVID-19 pneumonia patients [Table 1]; most of these drugs were designed for other purpose such as Ebola, influenza, parasites, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, and immune therapy for some autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Clinical trials have been conducted in which potential antiviral therapy targets were tested, such as blocking viral entry to human cells, inhibiting viral enzymes that were responsible for genome replication. Others focus on the human immune system to boost the innate response and inhibit the inflammatory process to relieve rapid progressed acute lung injuries. Global, large-scale, randomized clinical trials are still ongoing to test the safety and clinical outcomes of these drugs. Here, we summarize the mechanisms of potential therapeutic options that may combat the emerging SARS-CoV-2
